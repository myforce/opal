Building and installing H.263-1998
==================================

This codec is based on FFMPEG.

For Linux the confugure should find FFMPEG and point the compilation to it.
You just need to make sure it is installed, using yum or apt-get or
whatever your distribution needs.


For Windows, please follow the instructions in ../common/ReadMe.txt
