Building and installing H.263-1998
==================================

This plugin allows OPAL to use H.263 and H.263 (1998) aka H.263+ video codecs.

The plugin uses the FFMPEG library, also known as libavcodec, to encode and
decode video data. Please follow the instructions in ../common/ReadMe.txt to
make sure the library is installed for your platform.
