The 7kHz and 14kHz bandwidth (16k samples/second and 32k samples/second) codecs defined
in G.722.1 require the licencing of patents from Polycom, in most countries. However, a royalty
free licence is available from Polycom if certain fairly basic conditions are met. Please contact
Polycom for their current licence conditions.

For details of the precise license conditions for the original source code, please consult
Polycom. Polycom permit licenced users of G.722.1 to base their implementations on the
reference code, so any valid licencee is permitted to use this library.

No additional license conditions are claimed over this implementation.
