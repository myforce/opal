// PProcess

/**This class represents an operating system process. This is a running
   "programme" in the  context of the operating system. Note that there can
   only be one instance of a PProcess class in a given programme.
   
   The instance of a PProcess or its GUI descendent <code>PApplication</code> is
   usually a static variable created by the application writer. This is the
   initial "anchor" point for all data structures in an application. As the
   application writer never needs to access the standard system
   <code>main()</code> function, it is in the library, the programmes
   execution begins with the virtual function <code>PThread::Main()</code> on a
   process.
