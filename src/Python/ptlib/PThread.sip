// PThread

/** This class defines a thread of execution in the system. A <i>thread</i> is
   an independent flow of processor instructions. This differs from a
   <i>process</i> which also embodies a program address space and resource
   allocation. So threads can share memory and resources as they run in the
   context of a given process. A process always contains at least one thread.
   This is reflected in this library by the <code>PProcess</code> class being
   descended from the <code>PThread</code> class.

   The implementation of a thread is platform dependent, but it is
   assumed that the platform has some support for native threads.
   Previous versions of PTLib/PWLib have some support for co-operative
   threads, but this has been removed.

    /** Create a new thread instance. Unless the <code>startSuspended</code>
       parameter is <code>true</code>, the threads <code>Main()</code> function is called to
       execute the code for the thread.
       
       Note that the exact timing of the execution of code in threads can
       never be predicted. Thus you you can get a race condition on
       intialising a descendent class. To avoid this problem a thread is
       always started suspended. You must call the <code>Resume()</code> function after
       your descendent class construction is complete.

       If synchronisation is required between threads then the use of
       semaphores is essential.

       If the <code>deletion</code> is set to <code>AutoDeleteThread</code>
       then the <code>PThread</code> is assumed to be allocated with the new operator and
       may be freed using the delete operator as soon as the thread is
       terminated or executes to completion (usually the latter).

       The stack size argument retained only for source code compatibility for
       previous implementations. It is not used in the current code and
       may be removed in subsequent versions.

      constructor of the most descendant class. So, if you have a
      class B (which is descended of PThread), and a class C (which is
      descended of B), placing the call to <code>Resume()</code> in the constructor of B is
      unwise.

      If you do place a call to <code>Resume()</code> in the constructor, it
