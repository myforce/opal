 * Revision 2.10  2003/03/24 04:32:58  robertj
 * SIP register must have a server address
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2003/03/06 03:57:47  robertj
 * IVR support (work in progress) requiring large changes everywhere.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2002/10/09 04:27:44  robertj
 * Fixed memory leak on error reading PDU, thanks Ted Szoczei
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2002/09/12 06:58:34  robertj
 * Removed protocol prefix strings as static members as has problems with
 *   use in DLL environment.
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2002/07/04 07:41:47  robertj
 * Fixed memory/thread leak of transports.
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2002/04/10 03:15:17  robertj
 * Fixed using incorrect field as default reply address on receiving a respons PDU.
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2002/04/09 08:04:01  robertj
 * Fixed typo in previous patch!
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2002/04/09 07:18:33  robertj
 * Fixed the default return address for PDU requests not attached to connection.
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2002/04/05 10:42:04  robertj
 * Major changes to support transactions (UDP timeouts and retries).
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2002/02/01 04:53:01  robertj
