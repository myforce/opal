 * Added missing magic cookie. Fixes Ekiga report #485407.
 *
 * Revision 2.151  2007/10/10 01:23:20  rjongbloed
 * Fixed server address from SRV lookup being overwritten by URI host.
 *
 * Revision 2.150  2007/10/03 23:59:05  rjongbloed

 * Fixed errors on 64 bit Linux
 *
 * Revision 2.148  2007/09/21 01:34:10  rjongbloed
 * Rewrite of SIP transaction handling to:
 *   a) use PSafeObject and safe collections
 *   b) only one database of transactions, remove connection copy
 *   c) fix timers not always firing due to bogus deadlock avoidance
 *   d) cleaning up only occurs in the existing garbage collection thread
 *   e) use of read/write mutex on endpoint list to avoid possible deadlock
 *

 * Thanks to Simon Zwahlen
 *
 * Revision 2.146  2007/09/04 03:10:28  rjongbloed
 * Make sure late arriving 1xx responses do not "reset" the transaction state when
 *   it is already completed. Also assure a completed transaction only passes the
 *   response that did the completion on to connection/endpoint so multiple
 *   responses do not confuse higher level logic.
 *
 * Revision 2.145  2007/08/24 06:38:53  csoutheren

 *
 * Revision 2.130  2007/06/09 15:40:05  dsandras
 * Fixed routing of ACK PDUs. Only an ACK sent for a non 2XX response needs
 * to copy the Route header from the original request.
 *
 * Revision 2.129  2007/06/05 21:37:28  dsandras
 * Use the route set directly from the PDU instead of using the route set
 * from the connection. Make sure the route set is being used when routing

 * PDUs which is different to the one being used in the original REGISTER request.
 * Added code to use the same Contact field in both cases if we can determine that
 * we are registered to that specific account and if there is a transport running.
 * Fixed problem where the SIP connection was not released with a BYE PDU when
 * the ACK is received while we are already in EstablishedPhase.
 *

 * Fixed incorrect read of zero length SIP body, thanks Nick Hoath
 *
 * Revision 2.28  2004/03/23 09:43:42  rjongbloed
 * Fixed new C++ stream I/O compatibility, thanks Ted Szoczei
 *
 * Revision 2.27  2004/03/20 09:11:52  rjongbloed
 * Fixed probelm if inital read of stream fr SIP PDU fails. Should not then read again using
 *   >> operator as this then blocks the write due to the ios built in mutex.
 * Added timeout for "inter-packet" characters received. Waits forever for the first byte of
 *   a SIP PDU, then only waits a short time for the rest. This helps with getting a deadlock
 *   if a remote fails to send a full PDU.
 *
 * Revision 2.26  2004/03/16 12:06:11  rjongbloed
 * Changed SIP command URI to always be same as "to" address, not sure if this is correct though.
 *
 * Revision 2.25  2004/03/14 10:14:13  rjongbloed
 * Changes to REGISTER to support authentication
 *
 * Revision 2.24  2004/03/14 08:34:10  csoutheren
 * Added ability to set User-Agent string
