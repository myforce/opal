# Revision 1.2  2006/07/22 00:24:55  dereksmithies
# Add linux magic so it compiles and runs on linux.
# Add the command wxrc to turn the openphone.xrc file into openphone.cxx
# Compile openphone.cxx, which defines the function InitXmlResource();
# Since openphone.cxx is an auto generated file, get cvs to ignore this file.
#
# Revision 1.1  2006/07/19 10:41:51  dereksmithies
# First steps towards having a unix compiled openphone.
