       Note: For audio media, if \p data is NULL then that indicates there is
       no incoming audio available from the jitter buffer. The application
       should output silence for a time. The \p written value should still
       contain the bytes of silence emitted, even though it will be larger
       that \p length.

       Also, it is expected that this function be real time. That is if 320
       bytes of PCM-16 are written, this function should take 20ms to execute.
       If not then the jitter buffer will not operate correctly and audio will
       not be of high quality. This timing can be simulated if required, see
       GetSynchronicity for more details.
