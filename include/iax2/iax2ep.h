 *
 *  $Log: iax2ep.h,v $
 *  Revision 1.12  2007/03/13 00:32:16  csoutheren
 *  Simple but messy changes to allow compile time removal of protocol
 *  options such as H.450 and H.460
 *  Fix MakeConnection overrides
 *
 *  Revision 1.11  2007/03/01 05:51:03  rjongbloed
 *  Fixed backward compatibility of OnIncomingConnection() virtual
 *    functions on various classes. If an old override returned FALSE
 *    then it will now abort the call as it used to.
 *
 *  Revision 1.10  2007/01/24 04:00:55  csoutheren
 *  Arrrghh. Changing OnIncomingConnection turned out to have a lot of side-effects
 *  Added some pure viritual functions to prevent old code from breaking silently
 *  New OpalEndpoint and OpalConnection descendants will need to re-implement
 *  OnIncomingConnection. Sorry :)
 *
 *  Revision 1.9  2007/01/12 02:39:00  dereksmithies
 *  Remove the notion of srcProcessors and dstProcessor lists from the ep.
 *  Ensure that the connection looks after the callProcessor.
 *
 *  Revision 1.8  2007/01/09 03:32:23  dereksmithies
 *  Tidy up and improve the close down process - make it more robust.
 *  Alter level of several PTRACE statements. Add Terminate() method to transmitter and receiver.
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2006/12/18 03:18:41  csoutheren
 *  Messy but simple fixes
 *    - Add access to SIP REGISTER timeout
 *    - Ensure OpalConnection options are correctly progagated
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2006/09/11 03:08:51  dereksmithies
 *  Add fixes from Stephen Cook (sitiveni@gmail.com) for new patches to
 *  improve call handling. Notably, IAX2 call transfer. Many thanks.
 *  Thanks also to the Google summer of code for sponsoring this work.
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2006/08/09 03:46:39  dereksmithies
 *  Add ability to register to a remote Asterisk box. The iaxProcessor class is split
 *  into a callProcessor and a regProcessor class.
 *  Big thanks to Stephen Cook, (sitiveni@gmail.com) for this work.
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2005/08/26 03:07:38  dereksmithies
 *  Change naming convention, so all class names contain the string "IAX2"
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2005/08/24 01:38:38  dereksmithies
 *  Add encryption, iax2 style. Numerous tidy ups. Use the label iax2, not iax
 *
 *  Revision 1.2  2005/08/04 08:14:17  rjongbloed
 *  Fixed Windows build under DevStudio 2003 of IAX2 code
 *
 *  Revision 1.1  2005/07/30 07:01:32  csoutheren
 *  Added implementation of IAX2 (Inter Asterisk Exchange 2) protocol
 *  Thanks to Derek Smithies of Indranet Technologies Ltd. for
 *  writing and contributing this code

       [iax2:]{username@][transport$]address[/extension][+context]
     
     where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
     type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which
     indicates a user Fred at gatekeeper size.com. Whereas for the PSTN
     endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
     first available PSTN line.
     
     The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
     is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
     FALSE is returned.
     
     This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
     continuing to occur in a new background thread.
     
     If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
     example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
     then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
     mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
