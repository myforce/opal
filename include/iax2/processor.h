/**This class defines what the processor is to do on receiving an ack
   for a full frame.  Thus, the processor sends a full frame (say
   Accept) and defines an action (using this class) to carry out on
   receiving the ack for the Accept.

   Essentially, this class provides us a means of "knowing" the other
   end has acted on the sent full frame. The action to do could be as
   simple as saying, "other end has accepted our Accept packet"

   It also helps us to move on in the call setup phase. On receipt of
   one particular ack packet, we send the next packet in the call
   process.  Thus, on receipt of a ack for a timestamp of X and oseqno
   of Y, we send this packet.
   
   The outgoing FullFrame has an inSeqNo, which must match the
   outSeqNo of the received ack frame.
