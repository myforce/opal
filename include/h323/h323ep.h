/**This class manages the H323 endpoint.
   An endpoint may have zero or more listeners to create incoming connections
   or zero or more outgoing conenctions initiated via the MakeCall() function.
   Once a conection exists it is managed by this class instance.

   The main thing this class embodies is the capabilities of the application,
   that is the codecs and protocols it is capable of.

   An application may create a descendent off this class and overide the
   CreateConnection() function, if they require a descendent of H323Connection
   to be created. This would be quite likely in most applications.

       This is called from the OpalManager::SetUpConnection() function once
       it has determined that this is the endpoint for the protocol.

       The general form for this party parameter is:

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which
       indicates a user Fred at gatekeeper size.com. Whereas for the PSTN
       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
       is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
       FALSE is returned.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
       made.

       The default behaviour is pure.
