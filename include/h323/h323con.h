 *   no threads can ever deadlock or access deleted connection.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/08/16 07:49:16  robertj
 * Changed the H.450 support to be more extensible. Protocol handlers

 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/08/06 03:08:11  robertj
 * Fission of h323.h to h323ep.h & h323con.h, h323.h now just includes files.

       This function must be defined by the descendent class. It is used
       to select the logical channels to be opened between the two endpoints.
       There are three ways in which this may be called: when a "fast start"
       has been initiated by the local endpoint (via SendSignalSetup()
       function), when a "fast start" has been requested from the remote
       endpoint (via the OnReceivedSignalSetup() function) or when the H245
       capability set (and master/slave) negotiations have completed (via the
       OnControlChannelOpen() function.

       The function would typically examine several member variable to decide
       which mode it is being called in and what to do. If fastStartState is
       FastStartDisabled then non-fast start semantics should be used. The
       H245 capabilities in the remoteCapabilities members should be
       examined, and appropriate transmit channels started using
       OpenLogicalChannel().

       If fastStartState is FastStartInitiate, then the local endpoint has
       initiated a call and is asking the application if fast start semantics
       are to be used. If so it is expected that the function call 
       OpenLogicalChannel() for all the channels that it wishes to be able to
       be use. A subset (possibly none!) of these would actually be started
       when the remote endpoint replies.

       If fastStartState is FastStartResponse, then this indicates the remote
       endpoint is attempting a fast start. The fastStartChannels member
       contains a list of possible channels from the remote that the local
       endpoint is to select which to accept. For each accepted channel it
       simply necessary to call the Start() function on that channel eg
       fastStartChannels[0].Start();

       that is available. This is according to the order of the capabilities
