       This is called from the OpalManager::MakeConnection() function once

       The general form for this party parameter is:

            isdn:number[@controller[:port]]

       where number is a phone number, and controller and port are an integers
       from 1 up to a maximum. If the latter are absent or zero, then the
       first available controller or port is used.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If false is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
