 * $Log: sipcon.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2020  2004/03/14 10:09:53  rjongbloed
 * Moved transport on SIP top be constructed by endpoint as any transport created on
 *   an endpoint can receive data for any connection.
 *
 * Revision 2.18  2004/03/13 06:30:03  rjongbloed
 * Changed parameter in UDP write function to void * from PObject *.
 *

 * Normalised RTP session management across protocols
 * Added support for NAT (via STUN)
 *
 * Revision 2.16  2004/02/07 02:20:32  rjongbloed

 *
 * Revision 2.14  2003/03/17 10:26:59  robertj
 * Added video support.
 *
 * Revision 2.13  2003/03/06 03:57:47  robertj
 * IVR support (work in progress) requiring large changes everywhere.
 *
 * Revision 2.12  2002/09/16 02:52:35  robertj
 * Added #define so can select if #pragma interface/implementation is used on
 *   platform basis (eg MacOS) rather than compiler, thanks Robert Monaghan.
 *
 * Revision 2.11  2002/04/16 07:53:15  robertj
 * Changes to support calls through proxies.
 *
 * Revision 2.10  2002/04/10 03:13:45  robertj

 *   now done ths same way in both SIP and H.323.
 * Major changes to RTP session management when initiating an INVITE.
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2002/04/09 01:02:14  robertj
 * Fixed problems with restarting INVITE on  authentication required response.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2002/04/08 02:40:13  robertj
 * Fixed issues with using double originate call, eg from simple app command line.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2002/04/05 10:42:04  robertj
 * Major changes to support transactions (UDP timeouts and retries).
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2002/03/15 10:55:28  robertj
 * Added ability to specify proxy username/password in URL.
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2002/03/08 06:28:19  craigs
 * Changed to allow Authorisation to be included in other PDUs
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2002/02/19 07:52:40  robertj
 * Restructured media bypass functions to fix problems with RFC2833.
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2002/02/13 04:55:59  craigs
 * Fixed problem with endless loop if proxy keeps failing authentication with 407
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2002/02/11 07:34:06  robertj
 * Changed SDP to use OpalTransport for hosts instead of IP addresses/ports
 * Added media bypass for streams between compatible protocols.
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2002/02/01 04:53:01  robertj
 * Added (very primitive!) SIP support.
