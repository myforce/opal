 * $Log: sipcon.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2066  2007/05/23 20:53:40  dsandras
 * We should release the current session if no ACK is received after
 * an INVITE answer for a period of 64*T1. Don't trigger the ACK timer
 * when sending an ACK, only when not receiving one.
 *
 * Revision 2.64  2007/05/15 07:26:38  csoutheren
 * Remove deprecated  interface to STUN server in H323Endpoint
 * Change UseNATForIncomingCall to IsRTPNATEnabled
 * Various cleanups of messy and unused code
 *
 * Revision 2.63  2007/05/10 04:45:10  csoutheren
 * Change CSEQ storage to be an atomic integer
 * Fix hole in transaction mutex handling
 *
 * Revision 2.62  2007/04/19 06:34:12  csoutheren
 * Applied 1703206 - OpalVideoFastUpdatePicture over SIP
 * Thanks to Josh Mahonin
 *
 * Revision 2.61  2007/04/03 05:27:29  rjongbloed
 * Cleaned up somewhat confusing usage of the OnAnswerCall() virtual
 *   function. The name is innaccurate and exists as a legacy from the
 *   OpenH323 days. it now only indicates how alerting is done
 *   (with/without media) and does not actually answer the call.
 *
 * Revision 2.60  2007/03/01 05:51:04  rjongbloed
 * Fixed backward compatibility of OnIncomingConnection() virtual
 *   functions on various classes. If an old override returned FALSE
 *   then it will now abort the call as it used to.
 *
 * Revision 2.59  2007/02/19 04:42:27  csoutheren
 * Added OnIncomingMediaChannels so incoming calls can optionally be handled in two stages
 *
 * Revision 2.58  2007/01/24 04:00:56  csoutheren
 * Arrrghh. Changing OnIncomingConnection turned out to have a lot of side-effects
 * Added some pure viritual functions to prevent old code from breaking silently
 * New OpalEndpoint and OpalConnection descendants will need to re-implement
 * OnIncomingConnection. Sorry :)
 *
 * Revision 2.57  2007/01/18 04:45:16  csoutheren
 * Messy, but simple change to add additional options argument to OpalConnection constructor
 * This allows the provision of non-trivial arguments for connections
 *
 * Revision 2.56  2007/01/15 22:12:20  dsandras
 * Added missing mutex.
 *
 * Revision 2.55  2006/12/18 03:18:41  csoutheren
 * Messy but simple fixes
 *   - Add access to SIP REGISTER timeout
 *   - Ensure OpalConnection options are correctly progagated
 *
 * Revision 2.54  2006/11/11 12:23:18  hfriederich
 * Code reorganisation to improve RFC2833 handling for both SIP and H.323. Thanks Simon Zwahlen for the idea
