 * $Log: sipcon.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2032  2005/04/28 20:22:53  dsandras
 * Applied big sanity patch for SIP thanks to Ted Szoczei <tszoczei@microtronix.ca>.
 * Thanks a lot!
 *
 * Revision 2.30  2005/04/10 20:59:42  dsandras
 * Added call hold support (local and remote).
 *
 * Revision 2.29  2005/04/10 20:58:21  dsandras
 * Added function to handle incoming transfer (REFER).
 *
 * Revision 2.28  2005/04/10 20:57:18  dsandras
 * Added support for Blind Transfer (transfering and being transfered)
 *
 * Revision 2.27  2005/04/10 20:54:35  dsandras

 *
 * Revision 2.26  2005/02/19 22:48:48  dsandras

 *
 * Revision 2.25  2005/01/16 11:28:05  csoutheren
 * Added GetIdentifier virtual function to OpalConnection, and changed H323
 * and SIP descendants to use this function. This allows an application to
 * obtain a GUID for any connection regardless of the protocol used
 *
 * Revision 2.24  2004/12/25 20:43:41  dsandras
 * Attach the RFC2833 handlers when we are in connected state to ensure
 * OpalMediaPatch exist. Fixes problem for DTMF sending.

 * Added definition for ForwardCall.
 *
 * Revision 2.22  2004/08/20 12:13:31  rjongbloed
 * Added correct handling of SIP 180 response

 * Added RTP statistics callback to SIP
 *
 * Revision 2.19  2004/03/14 10:09:53  rjongbloed
 * Moved transport on SIP top be constructed by endpoint as any transport created on
 *   an endpoint can receive data for any connection.
 *
 * Revision 2.18  2004/03/13 06:30:03  rjongbloed
 * Changed parameter in UDP write function to void * from PObject *.
 *
 * Revision 2.17  2004/02/24 11:33:46  rjongbloed

 * Changed to allow opening of more than just audio streams.
 *
 * Revision 2.15  2003/12/20 12:21:18  rjongbloed

 *   now done ths same way in both SIP and H.323.
 * Major changes to RTP session management when initiating an INVITE.
 *
 * Revision 2.9  2002/04/09 01:02:14  robertj
 * Fixed problems with restarting INVITE on  authentication required response.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2002/04/08 02:40:13  robertj
 * Fixed issues with using double originate call, eg from simple app command line.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2002/04/05 10:42:04  robertj
 * Major changes to support transactions (UDP timeouts and retries).
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2002/03/15 10:55:28  robertj
