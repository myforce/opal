 * $Log: sipcon.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2034  2005/07/11 01:52:24  csoutheren
 * Extended AnsweringCall to work for SIP as well as H.323
 * Fixed problems with external RTP connection in H.323
 * Added call to OnClosedMediaStream
 *
 * Revision 2.32  2005/05/06 07:37:06  csoutheren
 * Various changed while working with SIP carrier
 *   - remove assumption that authentication realm is a domain name.
 *   - stopped rewrite of "To" field when proxy being used
 *   - fix Contact field in REGISTER to match actual port used when Symmetric NATin use
 *   - lots of formatting changes and cleanups
 *
 * Revision 2.31  2005/04/28 20:22:53  dsandras
 * Applied big sanity patch for SIP thanks to Ted Szoczei <tszoczei@microtronix.ca>.
 * Thanks a lot!
