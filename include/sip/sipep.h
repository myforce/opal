 * $Log: sipep.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2088  2007/09/04 05:40:15  rjongbloed
 * Added OnRegistrationStatus() call back function so can distinguish
 *   between initial registration and refreshes.
 *
 * Revision 2.86  2007/07/22 13:02:11  rjongbloed
 * Cleaned up selection of registered name usage of URL versus host name.
 *
 * Revision 2.85  2007/06/29 06:59:56  rjongbloed
 * Major improvement to the "product info", normalising H.221 and User-Agent mechanisms.
 *
 * Revision 2.84  2007/06/25 05:16:19  rjongbloed
 * Changed GetDefaultTransport() so can return multiple transport names eg udp$ AND tcp$.
 * Changed listener start up so if no transport is mentioned in the "interface" to listen on
 *   then will listen on all transports supplied by GetDefaultTransport()
 *
 * Revision 2.83  2007/06/10 08:55:11  rjongbloed
 * Major rework of how SIP utilises sockets, using new "socket bundling" subsystem.
 *
 * Revision 2.82  2007/05/21 04:30:30  dereksmithies
 * put #ifndef _PTLIB_H protection around the include of ptlib.h
 *
 * Revision 2.81  2007/05/18 00:35:11  csoutheren

 * Add symbol so applications know about presence of presence :)
 *
 * Revision 2.80  2007/05/16 01:16:20  csoutheren
 * Added new files to Windows build
 * Removed compiler warnings on Windows
 * Added backwards compatible SIP Register function
 *
 * Revision 2.79  2007/05/15 20:46:00  dsandras

 * waiting indications, registrations, state publishing,
 * message conversations, ...
 * Adds/fixes support for RFC3856, RFC3903, RFC3863, RFC3265, ...
 * Many improvements over the original SIPInfo code.
 * Code contributed by NOVACOM (http://www.novacom.be) thanks to

 *
 * Revision 2.76  2007/04/15 10:09:14  dsandras
 * Some systems like CISCO Call Manager do not like having a Contact field in INVITE
 * PDUs which is different to the one being used in the original REGISTER request.
 * Added code to use the same Contact field in both cases if we can determine that
 * we are registered to that specific account and if there is a transport running.
 * Fixed problem where the SIP connection was not released with a BYE PDU when
 * the ACK is received while we are already in EstablishedPhase.

       The general form for this party parameter is:

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which
       indicates a user Fred at gatekeeper size.com. Whereas for the PSTN
       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
       is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
       FALSE is returned.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
       made.
