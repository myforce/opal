       For endpoints that do not use STUN or something similar to set up all the
       correct protocol embeddded addresses correctly when a NAT router is between
       the endpoints, it is possible to still accommodate the call, with some
       restrictions. This function determines if the RTP can proceed with special
       NAT allowances.

       The special allowance is that the RTP code will ignore whatever the remote
       indicates in the protocol for the address to send RTP data and wait for
       the first packet to arrive from the remote and will then proceed to send
       all RTP data back to that address AND port.

       The default behaviour checks the values of the physical link
       (localAddr/peerAddr) against the signaling address the remote indicated in
       the protocol, eg H.323 SETUP sourceCallSignalAddress or SIP "To" or
       "Contact" fields, and makes a guess that the remote is behind a NAT router.
