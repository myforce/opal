/**This class describes an endpoint base class.
   Each protocol (or psuedo-protocol) would create a descendant off this
   class to manage its particular subsystem. Typically this would involve
   listening for incoming connections and being able to set up outgoing
   connections. Depending on exact semantics it may need to spawn many threads
   to achieve this.

   An endpoint will also have a default set of media data formats that it can
   support. Connections created by it would initially have the same set, but
   according to the semantics of the underlying protocol may end up using a
   different set.

   Various call backs are provided for points in the connection management. As
   a rule these are passed straight on to the OpalManager for processing. An
   application may create descendants off this class' subclasses, eg
   H323EndPoint, to modify or monitor its behaviour but it does not have to do
   so as all basic operations are passed to the OpalManager so only that class
   need be subclassed.

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which

       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
       is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
       FALSE is returned.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
