/**This class describes an endpoint base class.
   Each protocol (or psuedo-protocol) would create a descendant off this
   class to manage its particular subsystem. Typically this would involve
   listening for incoming connections and being able to set up outgoing
   connections. Depending on exact semantics it may need to spawn many threads
   to achieve this.

   An endpoint will also have a default set of media data formats that it can
   support. Connections created by it would initially have the same set, but
   according to the semantics of the underlying protocol may end up using a
   different set.

   Various call backs are provided for points in the connection management. As
   a rule these are passed straight on to the OpalManager for processing. An
   application may create descendants off this class' subclasses, eg
   H323EndPoint, to modify or monitor its behaviour but it does not have to do
   so as all basic operations are passed to the OpalManager so only that class
   need be subclassed.

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which

       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
       is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
       false is returned.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If false is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged

       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being

       For example in SIP, the OpalCall::Transfer() function will have sent a
       REFER request to the remote party. The remote party sends us NOTIFY
       requests about the progress of the REFER request.

       An application can now make a decision during the transfer operation
       to short circuit the sequence, or let it continue. It can also
       determine if the transfer did not go through, and it should "take back"
       the call. Note no action is required to "take back" the call other than
       indicate to the user that they are back on.

       A return value of false will immediately disconnect the current call.

       The exact format of the \p info parameter is dependent on the protocol
       being used. As a minimum, it will always have a values info["result"]
       and info["party"].

       The info["party"] indicates the part the \p connection is playing in
       the transfer. This will be:
          "A"   party being transferred
          "B"   party initiating the transfer of "A"
          "C"   party "A" is being transferred to

       The info["result"] will be at least one of the following:
          "success"     Transfer completed successfully (party A or B)
          "incoming"    New call was from a transfer (party C)
          "started"     Transfer operation has started (party A)
          "progress"    Transfer is in progress (party B)
          "blind"       Transfer is blind, no further notification (party B)
          "error"       Transfer could not begin (party B)
          "failed"      Transfer started but did not complete (party A or B)

       For SIP, there may be an additional info["state"] containing the NOTIFY
       subscription state, an info["code"] entry containing the 3 digit
       code returned in the NOTIFY body and info["Referred-By"] indicating the
       URI of party B. Other fields may also be present.

       The default behaviour calls the OpalManager function of the same name.
