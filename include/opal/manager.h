/**This class is the central manager for OPAL.
   The OpalManager embodies the root of the tree of objects that constitute an
   OPAL system. It contains all of the endpoints that make up the system. Other
   entities such as media streams etc are in turn contained in these objects.
   It is expected that an application would only ever have one instance of
   this class, and also descend from it to override call back functions.

   The manager is the eventual destination for call back indications from
   various other objects. It is possible, for instance, to get an indication
   of a completed call by creating a descendant of the OpalCall and overriding
   the OnClearedCall() virtual. However, this could quite unwieldy for all of
   the possible classes, so the default behaviour is to call the equivalent
   function on the OpalManager. This allows most applications to only have to
   create a descendant of the OpalManager and override virtual functions there
   to get all the indications it needs.

       An appropriate protocol (endpoint) is determined from the party
       parameter. That endpoint is then called to create a connection and that
       connection attached to the call provided.
       
       If the endpoint is already occupied in a call then the endpoints list
       is further searched for additional endpoints that support the protocol.
       For example multiple pstn endpoints may be present for multiple LID's.
       
       The general form for this party parameter is:

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which
       indicates a user Fred at gatekeeper size.com. Whereas for the PSTN
       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The default for the proto is the name of the protocol for the first
       endpoint attached to the manager. Other fields default to values on an
       endpoint basis.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
