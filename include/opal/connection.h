/*! \page pageOpalConnections Connection handling in the OPAL library

\section secOverview Overview 
This page of the documentation is designed to provide an understanding of the
use of the OpalConnection class in the OPAL library. From the description, you
will be able to add your own voip protocol to OPAL, and utilise the features
provided by the existing class structure. 

Key to understanding the OpalConnection class is that this class is
responsible for supervising the call signaling and media control for one call.

There will be one descendant of this OpalConnection class created for each
protocol that is supported.


\section secCallPhases Call Phases

Defined in OpalConnection, there is an enum (OpalConnection::Phases) that describes the
different stages of the call. Note that all OpalConnection instances go
through these phases as a call progresses. Even the OpalPCSSConnection, which
is the connection of PCM audio to/from the sound card, will (at some time) be
in each of the available phases.

To illustrate the meaning of the phases, we will descibe a very simple voip
protocol. This example protocol will also be used to show when the different
callbacks happen, and when the phases are changed at either endpoint of the
call. 

The two endpoints in the call are labelled L and R (left and right). L is making a call to R

\li L goes to OpalConnection::SetUpPhase, and  sends invite packet to R
\li R goes to OpalConnection::SetUpPhase, and starts ringing the phone
\li R goes to OpalConnection::AlertingPhase
\li R sends a message to L, "my phone is ringing"
\li L goes to OpalConnection::AlertingPhase
\li L sends a message to R, "I can only do G711 ALaw, RTP data to port 5400"
\li R sends s message to L, "Ok, we talk with G711 ALaw, send RTP data to me on port 5401"
\li R and L both wait for R's user to accept the ringing phone
\li R's user accepts the call by picking up the phone
\li R goes to OpalConnection::ConnectedPhase
\li R tells L that the call is accepted
\li L goes to OpalConnection::ConnectedPhase
\li R notices that media type is agreed on, the call is accepted, so goes to OpalConnection::EstablishedPhase
\li R realises that L knows everything is good for a call, so sends media to L
\li L reads the accepted message from R, goes to OpalConnection::EstablishedPhase
\li L sends media to R
\li both L and R exchange G711 ALaw on RTP port s 5400 and 5401
\li L (it could be R) sends a hangup message to R
\li L goes to OpalConnection::ReleasingPhase, and then stops all media traffic.
\li R receives the hangup message, goes to OpalConnection::ReleasingPhase, and stops all media traffic
\li L (and R) switch to OpalConnection::ReleasedPhase when all media and control streams have been terminated.

In the example above, if R had answered yes immediately, the call could not
move immediately to OpalConnection::EstablishedPhase as the media types were
not agreed on.

In the example above, we have described the decision process as to the codec
type, and the ports used. This decision process is not necessarily directly
handled by the OpalConnection descendant. For IAX2, where media negotiation is
an integral part of setting up the call, the IAX2Connection does media
negotiation. However, for SIP, there are SDPBandwidth, SDPMediaDescription,
SDPMediaFormat, SDPSessionDescription classes for handling media
negotiation. For the case of a pstn gateway using ISDN, there is no media
negotiation.  It always uses G.711 and the same "port" (the B channel).


The different phases are. 

  \li OpalConnection::UninitialisedPhase - there is no call active. An
                           OpalConnection takes this phase when instantiated.

  \li OpalConnection::SetUpPhase - the call is being created. This is around
                           the time of the first packet, which announces the
                           intent to create a call. At this point, there is no
                           agreement on the media format etc.
 
  \li OpalConnection::AlertingPhase - the OpalConnection instance is aware the phone is ringing.

  \li OpalConnection::ConnectedPhase - both endpoints have accepted the call, there may or may
                            not be agreement on media at this time. Note that in many systems
                            this constitutes the start of charging for a call.

  \li OpalConnection::EstablishedPhase - we are "connected", there is agreement on the media
                            type, network ports, media can flow. This is the condition that
                            contitutes a call being "ready to use".

  \li OpalConnection::ReleasingPhase - Either side (L or R) has said
                        "hangup". The media streams are in the process of
                        closing down.

  \li OpalConnection::ReleasedPhase - Media and control streams have closed
                      down.  When the call is in this phase, there is no
                      possibility of additional messages between L and R.

  \li OpalConnection::NumPhases - Used for internal accounting. This indicates
                      that the phase is unknown.

\section secCallbacks OnEvent Callbacks in Opal

An OnXXX function is called when an external stimuli from the protocol occurs
and a SetXXX function may be called by OPAL to perform the protocol command. For
example OnAlerting is called when the H.323 ALERTING packet is received, and
SetAlerting transmits the ALERTING packet.

It is the OpalConnection class (or descendant) which is in charge of handling
the control packets of a particular protocol. Consequently, it is only
code in this class which sets the current call phase variable. Further, most
events are generated in the OpalConnection class, which are usually passed back to the
OpalEndPoint, then to the OpalManager, and usually on to the OpalCall class.

Consequently, if a descendant of the OpalManager has been created, the
application will have access to to notification on when the phase of a call
has changed. Applications may create descendants of the H323Connection and
SIPConnection to get protocol specific information about call progress.

Whenever the application does override a method in OpalManager (or
OpalEndPoint, or OpalConnection), the application should 
\li spend the minimum of time in the overridden method, as this is holding up
     call processing
\li call the method that was overridden, to ensure the correct operation of
    Opal


The stages in a call, as applies to the methods provided by the OpalEndPoint,
OpalConnection, OpalCall and Manager classes.  

\li The OpalConnection derivative, on deciding that a call is ready to begin
     negotiations as to media etc, sets the phase to
     OpalConnection::SetUpPhase, and invoke OpalCall::OnSetUp(). Note that it
     is only partyA which invokes OpalCall::OnSetUp(). Then, for the other
     OpalConnection instance in this voip call, the methods
     OpalConnection::SetUpConnection and OpalConnection::OnSetUpConnection are
     invoked. The OpalConnection::OnSetUpConnection then invokes
     OpalEndPoint::OnSetUpConnection(). 

\li The recipient of an incoming voip call (R from example above) will go
     straight from OpalConnection::UninitialisedPhase to
     OpalConnection::AlertingPhase, on receipt of the INVITE/Hello packet. The
     initiator of a voip call (L from example above) moves to
     OpalConnection::AlertingPhase on receiving a notice the call has not been
     immediately rejected.

\li When an OpalConnection instance moves to OpalConnection::OnAlerting
    phase, which invokes OpalConnection::OnAlerting, which invokes
    OpalEndPoint::OnAlerting, which invokes OpalManager::OnAlerting, which
    invokes OpalCall::OnAlerting. The OpalCall::OnAlerting method then invokes
    the OpalConnection::SetAlerting method of the other OpalConnection
    instance in this call (which is partyB). Consequently, when one
    OpalConnection instance in a call does OpalConnection::OnAlerting, the
    other OpalConnection instance in the call does a
    OpalConnection::SetAlerting.

\li The method for deciding on the appropriate media to use, and for deciding
    when the user at R actually picks up the remote phone to accept the call,
    is entirely protocol specific. This decision making process is handled
    by code in the descendant of the OpalConnection class. As much of the
    common behaviour is abstracted to OpalConnection, OpalMediaFormat etc
    as possible, but the details must reside in the OpalConnection.

\li When the signaling is completed, and the call is accepted at R, both L and R
     will move to the OpalConnection::ConnectedPhase, and invoke
     OpalConnection::OnConnected.  which invokes OpalEndPoint::OnConnected,
     which invokes OpalManager::OnConnected, which invokes
     OpalCall::OnConnected. The OpalCall::OnConnected method then invokes the
     OpalConnection::SetConnected method of the other OpalConnection instance
     in this call (which is partyB). Consequently, when one OpalConnection
     instance in a call does OpalConnection::OnConnected, the other
     OpalConnection instance in the call does a OpalConnection::SetConnected.
     The operation of the OpalConnection::SetConnected method is currently
     empty - it is a protocol dependant thing exactly how to respond.

\li When the media is decided on, and the call has been accepted at R, media
     can flow. At the point where the media threads are created and agreed on
     at both ends, the call is marked as OpalConnection::OnEstablished. It is
     the transition to the established phase that starts the media
     streams. The descendant of OpalConnection decides to move to established
     phase, and invokes OpalConnection::OnEstablished.  which starts the media
     streams and invokes OpalEndPoint::OnEstablished, which invokes
     OpalManager::OnEstablished., which invokes OpalCall::OnEstablished. The
     OpalCall::OnEstablished method then checks that there are two
     OpalConnection instances in the call, and starts the media streams on the
     calling connection. The OpalCall::OnEstablished method then checks that
     all OpalConnection instances in this call are marked as
     Established. Fininally, the OpalCall::OnEstablishedCall method is
     invoked, which then invokes OpalManager::OnEstablishedCall. The
     OpalManager::OnEstablishedCall method is empty, but if an application
     overrides this method, the application will get notification of when a
     call has started sending media.

\li Calls are terminated by the OpalManager::ClearCall method, which invokes
    OpalCall::Clear. For each OpalConnection instance in the OpalCall class,
    the OpalConnection::Release method is invoked. The call phase is switched
    to OpalConnection::ReleasingPhase and a thread is created to close down
    the OpalConnection instance. This thread invokes
    OpalConnection::OnRelease, which then invokes OpalConnection::OnReleased,
    closes the media streams, and then invokes OpalEndPoint::OnReleased. The
    endpoint invokes OpalManager::OnReleased, which invokes
    OpalCall::OnReleased. The OpalCall::OnReleased method will do
    OpalConnection::Release() on the other OpalConnection instance managed by
    the OpalCall (if the other OpalConnection is still there). Once all
    OpalConnection instances have gone from the OpalCall, OpalCall::OnCleared
    is invoked, which invokes OpalManager::OnClearedCall. The
    OpalManager::OnClearedCall method is empty, but can be overridden by the
    application to get notification when all components of a call (media,
    control) have fully terminated.

          "incoming"    New call was from a transfer (party C)

          "error"       Transfer could not begin (party B)
          "failed"      Transfer started but did not complete (party A or B)

       For SIP, there may be an additional info["state"] containing the NOTIFY
       subscription state, an info["code"] entry containing the 3 digit
       code returned in the NOTIFY body and info["Referred-By"] indicating the
       URI of party B. Other fields may also be present.
