 * Revision 1.2083  2007/05/15 05:24:50  csoutheren
 * Add UseNATForIncomingCall override so applications can optionally implement their own NAT activation strategy
 *
 * Revision 2.81  2007/05/07 14:13:51  csoutheren
 * Add call record capability
 *
 * Revision 2.80  2007/04/26 07:01:01  csoutheren
 * Add extra code to deal with getting media formats from connections early enough to do proper
 * gatewaying between calls. The SIP and H.323 code need to have the handing of the remote
 * and local formats standardized, but this will do for now
 *
 * Revision 2.79  2007/04/18 00:00:44  csoutheren
 * Add hooks for recording call audio
 *
 * Revision 2.78  2007/04/03 05:27:29  rjongbloed
 * Cleaned up somewhat confusing usage of the OnAnswerCall() virtual
 *   function. The name is innaccurate and exists as a legacy from the
 *   OpenH323 days. it now only indicates how alerting is done
 *   (with/without media) and does not actually answer the call.
 *
 * Revision 2.77  2007/03/13 00:32:16  csoutheren
 * Simple but messy changes to allow compile time removal of protocol
 * options such as H.450 and H.460
 * Fix MakeConnection overrides
 *
 * Revision 2.76  2007/03/01 05:51:03  rjongbloed
 * Fixed backward compatibility of OnIncomingConnection() virtual
 *   functions on various classes. If an old override returned FALSE
 *   then it will now abort the call as it used to.
 *
 * Revision 2.75  2007/03/01 05:05:20  csoutheren
 * Fixed problem with override of OnIncomingConnection
 *
 * Revision 2.74  2007/03/01 03:52:31  csoutheren
 * Use local jitter buffer values rather than getting direct from OpalManager
 * Allow OpalConnection string options to be set during incoming calls
 *
 * Revision 2.73  2007/02/23 01:01:35  csoutheren
 * Added abilty to set Q.931 codes through normal OpalConnection::CallEndReason
 *
 * Revision 2.72  2007/02/19 04:42:27  csoutheren
 * Added OnIncomingMediaChannels so incoming calls can optionally be handled in two stages
 *
 * Revision 2.71  2007/02/12 02:44:27  csoutheren
 * Start of support for ZRTP
 *
 *
 * Revision 2.70  2007/01/24 04:00:56  csoutheren
 * Arrrghh. Changing OnIncomingConnection turned out to have a lot of side-effects
 * Added some pure viritual functions to prevent old code from breaking silently
 * New OpalEndpoint and OpalConnection descendants will need to re-implement
 * OnIncomingConnection. Sorry :)
 *
 * Revision 2.69  2007/01/18 04:45:16  csoutheren
 * Messy, but simple change to add additional options argument to OpalConnection constructor
 * This allows the provision of non-trivial arguments for connections
 *
 * Revision 2.68  2006/12/18 03:18:41  csoutheren
 * Messy but simple fixes
 *   - Add access to SIP REGISTER timeout
 *   - Ensure OpalConnection options are correctly progagated
 *
 * Revision 2.67  2006/12/08 04:22:06  csoutheren

 *
 * Revision 2.66  2006/11/20 03:37:12  csoutheren

 *
 * Revision 2.65  2006/11/11 12:23:18  hfriederich

   A connection is part of a call, and will be "owned" by an OpalCall object.
   It is also attached to the creator endpoint to do any protocol specific
   management of the connection. However the deletion of the connection is
   done by a special thread in the OpalManager class. A connnection should
   never be deleted directly.

   The connection is also in charge of creating media streams. It may do this
