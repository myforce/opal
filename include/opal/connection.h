/**This is the base class for connections to an endpoint.
   A particular protocol will have a descendant class from this to implement
   the specific semantics of that protocols connection.

   A connection is part of a call, and will be "owned" by an OpalCall object.
   It is also attached to the creator endpoint to do any protocol specific
   management of the connection. However the deletion of the connection is
   done by a special thread in the OpalManager class. A connnection should
   never be deleted directly.

   The connection is also in charge of creating media streams. It may do this
   in respose to an explicit call to OpenMediaStream or implicitly due to
   requests in the underlying protocol.

   When media streams are created they must make requests for bandwidth which
