       example, an address of "tcp$10.0.0.1:1720" would create a TCP listening

       With HostOnly it would be equivalent to translating the above example

       Streamed would be identical to HostOnly and Datagram would translate
       the address to udp$10.0.0.1:0 before using it.

       With NoBinding then a compatible listener is created and no local
       binding is made. This is equivalent to translating the address to
       "tcp$*:0" so that only the overall protocol type is used.

       Also note that if the address has a trailing '+' character then the
