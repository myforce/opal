/**Describe a network transport address.
   This describes a full definition of a network transport address, which is
   usually more than just a host address. Broadly it consists of a low level
   protocol and a protocol specific address/port.

   At present only Internet Protocol based addresses are supported.

   There are some semantic differences when this is being used as an address
   to connect to, or as an address to listen on. The latter has several
   "wildcard" variants so it is not necessary to explicitly know a-priori
   everything about interfaces to start listening for incoming connections.

   The syntax of the OpalTransportAddress string is:

      transport-address = proto "$" proto-address

      proto         = "ip" | "tcp" | "udp" | "tls" | token

      proto-address = addrport | any-string
      addrport      = addr [ ":" port ]

      addr          = [ host ] [ "%" interface ]
      host          = hostname | IPv4address | IPv6address | "*"

      hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
      domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
      toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum

      IPv4address   = 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit

      IPv6address   = "[" hexpart [ "%" scope-id ] "]"
      hexpart       =  hexseq | hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
      hexseq        =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
      hex4          =  1*4 hexdigit
      hexdigit      = digit | A-F | a-f
      scope-id      = number | token

      interface     = number | any-string

      port          = number | token | "*"
      number        = *digit

      token       =  alpha * (alphanum)
      alphanum    = alpha | digit
      alpha       = A-Z | a-z
      digit       = 0-9

      any-string  = 1* (any-char)
      any-char    = %20-%7f

   The semantics of certain elements are as follows:
      addr         Must have at least one of host or "%" interface-name
      host = "*"   indicates a wildcard match for all IP addresses. Note that
                   for UDP there is a distinction between "*" and "0.0.0.0" and
                   "[::]". A "*" will listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, while the
                   INADDR_ANY and INADDR6_ANY values will only listen on that
                   version of IP. For tcp "*" is a synonym for "0.0.0.0".
      port = "*"   indicates port 0. This is only allowed when the
                   OpalTransportAddress is being used to "listen" on a socket.
                   It indicates any port number will do and should be allocated
                   by the operating system.
      port = token Indicates a string as defined by getservbyname()
      scope-id     Is dependent on the underlying operating system. For Win32
                   this must be a number indicating the interface id, for Linux
                   this may be string, e.g. "eth0". Generally, the scope-id is
                   only required to disambiguate "link-local" addresses.
      interface    The number here is not necessarily the same as the number in
                   scope-id. It is the index into the table returned by the
                   PIPSocket::GetInterfaceTable() function. The text version of
                   the interface is dependent on the operating system. For Linux
                   this is the expected "eth0" etc, for Win32 this can be a
                   quite long and complex name string.

   Examples:
      tcp$*:1720
          Listen  on all interfaces for TCP port 1720.
      udp$127.0.0.1:5060
          Indicate UDP port 5060 at local host
      udp$%ppp0:5060
          Listen on interface name ppp0, this may come on and off line at any
          time, and change the actual IP address used at any time. The system
          will do it's best to "do the right thing" in this situation.
      udp$10.0.1.1%Win32 Interface Name:5060
          Explicitly use address 10.0.1.1 on interface "Win32 interface name"
      tcp$my.host.domain.com:1720"
          A DNS lookup of my.host.domain.com is used to determine address.
      udp$[::]:5060
          Listen on all IPv6 interfaces. This differs from udp$*:5060 in that
          only IPv6 interfaces are listened to. Similarly udp$0.0.0.0:5060
          would only listen on IPv4 interfaces.
      udp$[fe80::224:21ff:fe9e:3e7b%26]:5060
          Send packet out on link-local address fe80::224:21ff:fe9e:3e7b and
          interface id 26.

       The BindOptions parameter indicates how the listener is to be created.

       With FullTSAP the the full address is used for any local binding, for
       example, an address of "tcp$10.0.0.1:1720" would create a TCP listening
       socket that would be bound to the specific interface 10.0.0.1 and
       listens on port 1720. Note that the address "tcp$*:1720" can be used
       to bind to INADDR_ANY, and a port number of zero indicates allocate a
       new random port number.

       With HostOnly it would be equivalent to translating the above example
       to "tcp$10.0.0.1:0" before using it.

       Using Streamed or Datagram is similar to HostOnly as only the host part
       of the address is used, but instead of using the protocol type specifed
       by the address it guarentees the specifeid type. In the above example
       Streamed would be identical to HostOnly and Datagram would translate
       the address to udp$10.0.0.1:0 before using it.

       With NoBinding then a compatible listener is created and no local
       binding is made. This is equivalent to translating the address to
       "tcp$*:0" so that only the overall protocol type is used.

       With RouteInterface, the address is considered a remote address and the
       created transport is bound only to the address associated with the
       interface that would be used to get to that address.

       Also note that if the address has a trailing '+' character then the
       socket will be bound using the REUSEADDR option, where relevant.
