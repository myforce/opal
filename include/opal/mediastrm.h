/*!< \page pageOpalMediaStream Media streams in the OPAL library

\section secOverviewM Overview
This page of the documentation is designed to provide an understanding of the
use of the OpalMediaStream class in the OPAL library. 

A voip call that is handled in OPAL consists of two instances of the
OpalConnection class (or derivative) plus instances of the
OpalMediaStream class (or derivatives). Consequently, for handling a
H.323 call which is directed to the PC speaker/microphone, there will
H323Connection and a PCSSConnection. OPAL requires that media can be
transferred between these two clases. To transfer the media, OPAL uses
the OpalMediaStream.

Key to understanding the OpalMediaStream class is that this class is
responsible for transferring media from one instance of an
OpalConnection to another instance of an OpalConnection.

\section secDescriptionM Description

From \ref pageOpalConnections, we see that derivatives of the
OpalConnection class take many different forms (depending on the
protocol). Further, the media from those protocols may well have
different forms. For example, H.323 and PCSS have quite different
format for the media. The class OpalMediaStream (and derivatives) is
responsible for making the format of the media (from each OpalConnection
instance) consistent.

The standard output format of an OpalMediaStream (or derivative) is a
RTP_DataFrame. Consequently, different OpalConnection instances (or
derivatives) can be connected together and exchange media (where the
media is encapsulated inside instances of the RTP_DataFrame class).

When handling an audio only call, each OpalConnection instance (or
derivative) has two attached OpalMediaStream instances (or
derivatives). When the call contains video and audio, each
OpalConnection instance (or derivative) will have four attached
OpalMediaStream instances (or derivatives).

For handling a H.323 call, which is an audio only call, that goes the speaker/microphone of the box, there will be 
\li one instance of a H323Connection
\li one instance of a OpalPCSSConnection
\li two instances of a OpalAudioMediaStream
\li two instances of a OpalRTPMediaStream

Note that an OpalMediaStream instance is designed to take media in one
direction.
