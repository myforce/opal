 * $Log: pcss.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2026  2006/12/18 03:18:41  csoutheren
 * Messy but simple fixes
 *   - Add access to SIP REGISTER timeout
 *   - Ensure OpalConnection options are correctly progagated
 *
 * Revision 2.24  2006/10/15 06:23:35  rjongbloed
 * Fixed the mechanism where both A-party and B-party are indicated by the application. This now works
 *   for LIDs as well as PC endpoint, wheich is the only one that was used before.
 *

 *   suitable connection types.
 *
 * Revision 2.21  2006/08/17 23:09:03  rjongbloed

 * before the echo cancellation filter.
 *
 * Revision 2.18  2005/12/27 22:25:55  dsandras
 * Added propagation of the callback to the pcss endpoint.
 *
 * Revision 2.17  2005/12/27 20:48:01  dsandras
 * Added media format parameter when opening the sound channel so that its
 * parameters can be used in the body of the method.
 *
 * Revision 2.16  2005/11/30 13:35:26  csoutheren
 * Changed tags for Doxygen
 *
 * Revision 2.15  2005/11/24 20:31:54  dsandras
 * Added support for echo cancelation using Speex.
 * Added possibility to add a filter to an OpalMediaPatch for all patches of a connection.
 *
 * Revision 2.14  2005/10/12 21:11:21  dsandras
 * Control if the video streams are started or not from this class.
 *
 * Revision 2.13  2004/08/14 07:56:29  rjongbloed
 * Major revision to utilise the PSafeCollection classes for the connections and calls.
 *
 * Revision 2.12  2004/07/11 12:42:10  rjongbloed

 * Added video support.
 *
 * Revision 2.8  2003/03/06 03:57:47  robertj
 * IVR support (work in progress) requiring large changes everywhere.
 *
 * Revision 2.7  2002/09/16 02:52:35  robertj
 * Added #define so can select if #pragma interface/implementation is used on
 *   platform basis (eg MacOS) rather than compiler, thanks Robert Monaghan.
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2002/06/16 02:19:31  robertj

       This is called from the OpalManager::MakeConnection() function once
       it has determined that this is the endpoint for the protocol.

       The general form for this party parameter is:

            [proto:][alias@][transport$]address[:port]

       where the various fields will have meanings specific to the endpoint
       type. For example, with H.323 it could be "h323:Fred@site.com" which
       indicates a user Fred at gatekeeper size.com. Whereas for the PSTN
       endpoint it could be "pstn:5551234" which is to call 5551234 on the
       first available PSTN line.

       The proto field is optional when passed to a specific endpoint. If it
       is present, however, it must agree with the endpoints protocol name or
       FALSE is returned.

       This function usually returns almost immediately with the connection
       continuing to occur in a new background thread.

       If FALSE is returned then the connection could not be established. For
       example if a PSTN endpoint is used and the assiciated line is engaged
       then it may return immediately. Returning a non-NULL value does not
       mean that the connection will succeed, only that an attempt is being
       made.
