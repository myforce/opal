 * $Log: patch.h,v $
 * Revision 1.2008  2005/08/31 13:19:25  rjongbloed
 * Added mechanism for controlling media (especially codecs) including
 *   changing the OpalMediaFormat option list (eg bit rate) and a completely
 *   new OpalMediaCommand abstraction for things like video fast update.
 *
 * Revision 2.6  2004/08/15 10:10:27  rjongbloed
 * Fixed possible deadlock when closing media patch
 *
 * Revision 2.5  2004/08/14 07:56:29  rjongbloed
 * Major revision to utilise the PSafeCollection classes for the connections and calls.
 *
 * Revision 2.4  2004/03/11 06:54:27  csoutheren
 * Added ability to disable SIP or H.323 stacks
 *
 * Revision 2.3  2003/03/17 10:26:59  robertj
 * Added video support.
 *
 * Revision 2.2  2002/09/16 02:52:35  robertj
 * Added #define so can select if #pragma interface/implementation is used on
 *   platform basis (eg MacOS) rather than compiler, thanks Robert Monaghan.
 *
 * Revision 2.1  2002/01/22 05:07:49  robertj
 * Added filter functions to media patch.
 *
 * Revision 2.0  2001/07/27 15:48:24  robertj
 * Conversion of OpenH323 to Open Phone Abstraction Library (OPAL)

   each sink stream in order to match the media data formats the streams are
   capabile of doing natively.

   the Resume() function is called on the patch when the creator code is
   ready for it to begin. For example all sink streams have been added.
