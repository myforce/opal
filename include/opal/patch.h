   This class is the thread of control that transfers data from one
   "source" OpalMediStream to one or more other "sink" OpalMediStream
   instances. It may use zero, one or two intermediary software codecs for
   each sink stream in order to match the media data formats the streams are
   capabile of doing natively.

   Note the thread is not actually started straight away. It is expected that
   the Resume() function is called on the patch when the creator code is
   ready for it to begin. For example all sink streams have been added.
